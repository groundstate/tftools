function [ bias, totcorr ] = totdevbias(tau,T,noisefn,tot)
%TOTDEVBIAS Calculates the bias correction for the Theo1
% deviation, given the noise type, and optionally corrects a vector
% of TOTDEV deviation values
%
%   Usage: [ bias, totcorr ] = TOTDEVBIAS(m,noisefn) 
%   Inputs:
%     
%     tau:  vector of averaging intervals
%				T:  time interval spanned by the data set
% noisefn: "white pm","flicker pm","white fm","flicker fm",
%             "random walk fm" (nb biased only for flicker fm and 
%							random walk fm)
%   theo1: optional: data to be corrected
%        
%   Outputs:
%     bias:  vector of bias corrections, defined as
%            bias(tau)= ADEV(tau)/TOTDEV(tau) - 1
% totcorr: corrected TOTDEV
