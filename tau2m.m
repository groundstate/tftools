function [ newtau,mtau ] = tau2m( tau,rate,x )
%TAU2M Converts tau to index, given the rate & sanitises input
%   Usage: [newtau,mtau] = taus2m(tau,rate,x)
%   tau is the vector of tau values
%   rate is data rate in Hz
%   x is the data
%   newtau is vector of sanitised tau values
%   mtau  is newtau in units of data points
