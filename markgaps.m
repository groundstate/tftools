function [ tn, xn ] = markgaps( t, x, dt)
%MARKGAPS finds and marks gaps in time series data
% Usage: [ tn, xn ] = MARKGAPS( t, x, dt)
% Inputs:
%   t     measurement times
%   x     measurements
%   dt    nominal data interval (s)
% Outputs:
%   Returns expanded input sequences, with missing data flagged by NaN
%

% Calculate the expected measurement times
