function [ dev,deverr, ndev ] = adev( x,rate,tau,overlap,phase, gaps )
%ADEV Calculate non-overlapping/overlapping Allan deviation of phase/
% or fractional frequency data
%   Usage: ADEV(x,rate,tau,overlap,phase,gaps) 
%   x is the input time series
%   rate is the sampling rate, in Hz
%   tau is the averaging interval 
%   overlap = 1 means compute overlapping ADEV
%   phase = 1 means data is phase
%   gaps = 1 means data contains gaps, tagged with NaN
%
%   Frequency data is converted internally to phase
%   
%   See also mdev, totdev.
